# Smart-City-Waste-Management-System-(SC-WMS)
The SC-WMS is responsible for maintaining cleanliness in a smart city by coordinating sensors in smart bins, garbage trucks, and a central control agent to ensure timely waste collection.


## Design and implement a DALI-based Multi-Agent System for Smart Waste Management that:
- Detects full waste bins,
- Coordinates garbage truck collection,
- Logs all activity,
- Supports decentralized and reactive behavior.
